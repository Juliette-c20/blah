<h1>Kamila Baker</h1>
<h2>Story of Her Life</h2>
<p>Kamila Baker was born in 2,369 B.C.E. to a poor family of nomads in the Sahara Desert. After her parents were killed in a brutal camel stampede, Kamila escaped in a banana crate on a cargo ship being sent to America. Unfortunately, the ship got caught in the middle of a hurricane and capsized as it rode over a Tsunami. Kamila's banana crate washed up on the sandy beaches of San Diego. She scavenged for food all alone on the beach, but was unsuccessful. Kamila became a homeless child and slept on a bench in the park. She lived there for 10,000 years, surviving off of raw squirrels in the park. She was unevolved and did not speak English, so she had trouble communicating with the Americans. Eventually, she was captured by the police and taken into an orphanage. Kamila was adopted by an old witch who forced her to clean the cellars and wash her cauldrons. Kamila was once attcked by the witch's evil cat, which left her blind in one eye. late one night, Kamila jumped out of her window and escaped the witch's lair. She then hitchiked in a Hippie Van all the way to New York City. It was in that van that she met her new best friend, another girl getting a ride to New York. She was also an unevolved monkey lady whose name was Juliette. They robbed a bank in Bellevue, Nebraska, and stole enough money to buy a penthouse in New York City. They happiy live there together to this day.</p>
